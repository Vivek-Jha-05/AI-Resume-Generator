üöÄ AI Resume & Cover Letter Generator (Desktop App)
This is a Python-based desktop application built with Tkinter and ReportLab that utilizes the Google Gemini API to quickly generate professional resume summaries, bullet points, project descriptions, and custom cover letters based on user inputs.

The application packages the entire resume and cover letter into a clean, ready-to-print PDF document.

‚ú® Features
AI Content Generation: Uses Gemini-2.5-Flash to craft professional summaries, action-verb-driven bullet points for work experience, and impactful project descriptions.

PDF Generation: Exports a single, professionally formatted PDF file for the resume and cover letter.

Dynamic UI: Allows users to add multiple work experience, project, and certification entries.

Hyperlinking: Automatically formats contact links (LinkedIn, URLs, etc.) as clickable hyperlinks in the final PDF.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation (Run from Source)
Clone the repository:

cd AI-Resume-Generator

Install dependencies:

python app.py

üì¶ Deployment (Creating a Standalone Executable)
To allow users to run the app without installing Python, use PyInstaller.

Ensure PyInstaller is installed (included in requirements.txt).

Run the following command in your terminal:

pyinstaller --onefile --windowed app.py

--onefile: Packages everything into a single executable file.

--windowed: Prevents a terminal window from opening alongside the GUI (for Windows/Mac).

The final executable (app.exe or app) will be located in the newly created dist/ folder.
